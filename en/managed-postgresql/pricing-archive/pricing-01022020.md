# Pricing policy for {{ mpg-name }} before February 1, 2020

This is the old version of the policy that was valid before February 1, 2020. To learn more about the current {{ mpg-name }} pricing policy, see [Pricing policy](../pricing.md).

## What goes into the cost of using {{ mpg-short-name }} {#rules}

The {{ mpg-name }} usage cost is based on:

* Disk type and storage size.

* [Host class](../concepts/instance-types.md) selected for the cluster.

* Number of DB hosts per cluster.

* Settings and number of backups.

* Amount of outgoing traffic.


{% include [pricing-gb-size](../../_includes/pricing-gb-size.md) %}

### DB host usage {#rules-hosts-uptime}

The cost is calculated for each hour of the host's operation in accordance with its class. You can find detailed class specifications in the [Host classes](../concepts/instance-types.md) section.

The minimum billing unit is one hour (for example, the cost of 1.5 hours of operation is the same as the cost of 2 hours of operation). You are not charged for the time when the {{ PG }} host is not performing its main functions.

### Disk space usage {#rules-storage}

You are charged for the following:

* Storage allocated for DB clusters.

   * Storage on fast local disks (`local-ssd`) can only be ordered for clusters with more than 3 hosts in 100 GB increments.


* Space used by DB backups in excess of the storage amount specified for the cluster.

   * Backups are stored free of charge as long as the combined size of the DB and all backups is smaller than the selected storage size.

   * During an automatic backup, {{ mpg-short-name }} does not create a new copy but saves changes to the database compared to the previous copy. This means that the storage used by automatic backups increases only in proportion to the volume of changes that are made.

   * The number of hosts in the cluster does not affect the size of the storage and, consequently, of free backups.

The cost is specified for one month of use. The minimum billing unit is 1 GB per hour (e.g., storing 1 GB for 1.5 hours costs the same as for 2 hours).


## Pricing {#prices}

{% note info %}

As of February 1, 2020, service pricing [changes](pricing-01022020.md#prices): the cost of clusters will be calculated directly based on the computing resources used, not the host class.
