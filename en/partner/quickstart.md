# How to participate in the partner program

The partner program enables you to make profit and grow your own business by addressing customer needs using the {{ yandex-cloud }} platform. You can become a partner through either the [VAR](./program/var.md) or the [referral](./program/referral.md) partnership program, as well as participate in both programs at once.

The partner program will enable you to:

* Promote your own solutions based on {{ yandex-cloud }}.
* Sell your solutions to new customers and boost demand among your current ones.
* Deliver integrated projects by offering pro-level services.

To get a partner status:

1. [Apply](https://cloud.yandex.ru/partners#partners-form) for a partner status. You will receive a welcome email at the email address specified in your application.
