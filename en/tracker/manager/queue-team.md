# Adding a queue team

{% note warning %}

By default, [only the queue owner](queue-access.md) can configure a queue.

{% endnote %}

The queue team is represented by employees who create and execute issues in a given queue. The queue team members get notified by email on any issue-related changes.

The queue owner is an employee who has full access to editing the queue settings.

You can set the queue team on the **Queue team** tab.

## Changing the queue owner {#change-owner}

The owner manages the queue:

* Edits the [main settings](edit-queue-general.md).
* Adds users to the [queue team](../glossary.md#queue-team).
* Configures [notifications](subscriptions.md).
* Changes [access rights to the queue](queue-access.md).

Changing the queue owner:

1. Open the [queue page](../user/queue.md).

1. In the top-right corner of the page, click ![](../../_assets/tracker/svg/settings-old.svg) **{{ ui-key.startrek.ui_components_PageQueue_header.settings }}**.
