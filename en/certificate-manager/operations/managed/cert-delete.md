   1. Open the {{ TF }} configuration file and delete the fragment with the certificate description:

      {% cut "Sample certificate description" %}

      ```hcl
      ...
      resource "yandex_cm_certificate" "le-certificate" {
        name        = "managed-certificate-for-dns"
        description = "this is a certificate for tls"
