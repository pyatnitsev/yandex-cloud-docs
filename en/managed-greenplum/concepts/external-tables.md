# External tables

{{ GP }} allows you to work with data from sources that are external to a {{ mgp-name }} cluster. This functionality uses _external tables_, which are special objects in a {{ GP }} database that reference external source tables, buckets, or files. Access to data in external DBMS's uses the [{{ GP }} Platform Extension Framework](../operations/external-tables.md) (PXF) protocol, whereas access to files on external file servers uses the [{{ GP }} Parallel File Server](../operations/gpfdist/connect.md) (`gpfdist`) utility.

With external tables, you can:

* Query external data sources.
* Load datasets from external sources into a {{ GP }} database.
* Join local and external tables in queries.
* Write data to external tables or files.

For security reasons, {{ mgp-name }} does not support the creation of external web tables that use shell scripts.

## External data sources for PXF operations {#pxf-data-sources}

{{ mgp-name }} uses _external data sources_ to create external tables. Each source is similar to a web server configuration used to access data in external DBMS's. This is why sources are only used for PXF operations.

Sources enable you to do the following:

* In the configuration, specify the parameters that cannot be included in an [SQL query for creating a PXF external table](../operations/pxf/create-table.md).
* Avoid explicitly specifying the user password in an SQL query for creating an external table.
* Simplify an SQL query for creating a table, as with a dedicated and configured source, you do not need to list configuration parameters in your query.
