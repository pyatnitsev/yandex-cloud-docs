#### What are the advantages of {{ mgl-name }} over a {{ GL }} Community Edition custom installation? {#advantages}

The main advantage of {{ mgl-name }} is that it reduces the installation and administration costs of {{ GL }}. In addition, {{ mgl-name }} adds functionality not found in the [Community Edition](https://about.gitlab.com/install/ce-or-ee/) (such as approval rules). For more information, see the [Service advantages over a {{ GL }} custom installation](../../managed-gitlab/concepts/managed-gitlab-vs-custom-installation.md) section.
