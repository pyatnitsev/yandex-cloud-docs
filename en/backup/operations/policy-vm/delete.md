# Deleting a backup policy

{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the [folder](../../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) where you want to delete a [backup policy](../../../backup/concepts/policy.md).
   1. In the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_backup }}**.
   1. Go to the ![policies](../../../_assets/console-icons/calendar.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.backup.label_policies }}** tab.
   1. Click ![image](../../../_assets/console-icons/ellipsis.svg) next to the backup policy you want to delete and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.delete }}**.
   1. Confirm the backup policy deletion.

- CLI {#cli}

   {% include [cli-install](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. See the description of the [CLI](../../../cli/) command to delete a [backup policy](../../../backup/concepts/policy.md):

      ```bash
      yc backup policy delete --help
      ```

   1. Get the ID of the backup policy you want to delete:

      {% include [get-policy-id](../../../_includes/backup/operations/get-policy-id.md) %}

   1. Delete the backup policy by specifying its ID:

      ```bash
      yc backup policy delete <backup_policy_ID>
      ```

      For more information about the command, see the [CLI reference](../../../cli/cli-ref/managed-services/backup/policy/delete.md).

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

  {% include [terraform-definition](../../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/terraform-definition.md) %}

  {% include [terraform-install](../../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

  To delete a [backup policy](../../../backup/concepts/policy.md) created with {{ TF }}:
  1. Open the {{ TF }} configuration file and delete the fragment with the `yandex_backup_policy` resource description:

     {% cut "Sample `yandex_backup_policy` resource description in the {{ TF }} configuration" %}

     ```hcl
     resource "yandex_backup_policy" "my_policy" {
         archive_name                      = "[<VM_name>]-[<plan_ID>]-[<unique_ID>]a"

             interval     = "1m"

         }

         retention {

             }
         }

         scheduling {

             scheme               = "ALWAYS_INCREMENTAL"
             weekly_backup_day    = "MONDAY"

             execute_by_time {

                 monthdays                 = []
                 months                    = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12]
                 repeat_at                 = ["04:10"]
                 repeat_every              = "30m"
                 type                      = "MONTHLY"
                 weekdays                  = []
             }
         }

         vm_snapshot_reattempts {
             enabled      = true
             interval     = "1m"
             max_attempts = 10
         }
     }
     ```

     {% endcut %}

     For more information about the `yandex_backup_policy` resource parameters, see the [provider documentation]({{ tf-provider-resources-link }}/backup_policy).
  1. Apply the changes:

     {% include [terraform-validate-plan-apply](../../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/terraform-validate-plan-apply.md) %}

     You can check the update using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or this [CLI](../../../cli/) command:

     ```bash
     yc backup policy list
     ```

- API {#api}

   To delete a [backup policy](../../concepts/policy.md), use the [delete](../../backup/api-ref/Policy/delete.md) REST API method for the [Policy](../../backup/api-ref/Policy/index.md) resource or the [PolicyService/Delete](../../backup/api-ref/grpc/policy_service.md#Delete) gRPC API call.
