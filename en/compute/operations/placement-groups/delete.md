{% list tabs group=instructions %}

- Management console {#console}

   1. In the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}), select the [folder](../../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) the placement group belongs to.
   1. In the list of services, select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.iam.folder.dashboard.label_compute }}**.
   1. In the left-hand panel, select ![image](../../../_assets/compute/group-placement-pic.svg) **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.switch_placement-groups }}**.
   1. Go to the **{{ ui-key.yacloud.compute.placement-groups.label_tab-instances }}** tab.
   1. In the line with the placement group, click ![image](../../../_assets/options.svg) and select **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.delete }}**.
   1. In the window that opens, click **{{ ui-key.yacloud.common.delete }}**.

- CLI {#cli}

   {% include [cli-install.md](../../../_includes/cli-install.md) %}

   {% include [default-catalogue.md](../../../_includes/default-catalogue.md) %}

   1. View a list of [VM](../../concepts/vm.md) instances in the placement group:

      ```bash
      yc compute placement-group list-instances --name my-group
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      +----------------------+---------------------+---------------+---------+-------------+-------------+
      |          ID          |        NAME         |    ZONE ID    | STATUS  | EXTERNAL IP | INTERNAL IP |
      +----------------------+---------------------+---------------+---------+-------------+-------------+
      | epdep2kq6dt5******** | instance-in-group-1 | {{ region-id }}-b | RUNNING |             | 10.129.0.5  |
      | epdlv1pp5401******** | instance-in-group-2 | {{ region-id }}-b | RUNNING |             | 10.129.0.30 |
      +----------------------+---------------------+---------------+---------+-------------+-------------+
      ```

   1. Delete the VM in the placement group:

      ```bash
      yc compute instance delete --name instance-in-group-1
      yc compute instance delete --name instance-in-group-2
      ```

   1. Delete the placement group:

      ```bash
      yc compute placement-group delete --name my-group
      ```

   1. Check that the placement group was deleted:

      ```bash
      yc compute placement-group list
      ```

      Result:

      ```text
      +----+------+----------+
      | ID | NAME | STRATEGY |
      +----+------+----------+
      +----+------+----------+
      ```

- {{ TF }} {#tf}

   {% include [terraform-definition](../../../_tutorials/_tutorials_includes/terraform-definition.md) %}

   {% include [terraform-install](../../../_includes/terraform-install.md) %}

   To delete a placement group created with {{ TF }}:
   1. Open the {{ TF }} configuration file and delete the fragment with the placement group description.

      Example placement group description in a {{ TF }} configuration:

      ```hcl
      ...
      resource "yandex_compute_placement_group" "group1" {
        name        = "test-pg"
        folder_id   = "b1gia87mbaom********"
        description = "my description"
      }
      ...
      ```

   1. In the command line, go to the directory with the {{ TF }} configuration file.
   1. Check the configuration using this command:

      ```bash
      terraform validate
      ```

      If the configuration is correct, you will get this message:

      ```text
      Success! The configuration is valid.
      ```

   1. Run this command:

      ```bash
      terraform plan
      ```

      The terminal will display a list of resources with parameters. No changes will be made at this step. If the configuration contains any errors, {{ TF }} will point them out.
   1. Apply the configuration changes:

      ```bash
      terraform apply
      ```

   1. Confirm the changes: type `yes` into the terminal and press **Enter**.

      You can check the update using the [management console]({{ link-console-main }}) or this [CLI](../../../cli/) command:

      ```bash
      yc compute placement-group list
      ```

- API {#api}

   Use the [delete](../../api-ref/PlacementGroup/delete.md) REST API method for the [PlacementGroup](../../api-ref/PlacementGroup/index.md) resource or the [PlacementGroupService/Delete](../../api-ref/grpc/placement_group_service.md#Delete) gRPC API call.
